# vault-lambda-extension

This repository contains the source code for Hashicorp's Vault AWS Lambda extension.
The extension utilizes the AWS Lambda Extensions API to read secrets from your
Vault deployment and write the result to disk before the Lambda function itself
starts to execute. To use it, include the following ARN as a layer in your
Lambda function:

```text
arn:aws:lambda:us-east-1:634166935893:layer:vault-lambda-extension:6
```

Where region may be any of `ap-northeast-1`, `ap-northeast-2`, `ap-south-1`,
`ap-southeast-1`, `ap-southeast-2`, `ca-central-1`, `eu-central-1`,
`eu-west-1`, `eu-west-2`, `eu-west-3`, `sa-east-1`, `us-east-1`, `us-east-2`,
`us-west-1`, `us-west-2`.

The extension authenticates with Vault using [AWS IAM auth][vault-aws-iam-auth],
and writes the result as JSON to disk. It also writes a vault token to
`/tmp/vault/token`. All configuration is supplied via environment variables.

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

The [quick-start](./quick-start) directory has an end to end example, for which
you will need an AWS account and some command line tools. Follow the readme in
that directory if you'd like to try out the extension from scratch. **Please
note it will create real infrastructure with an associated cost as per AWS'
pricing.**

### Adding the extension to your existing Lambda and Vault infrastructure

Requirements:

* ARN of the role your Lambda runs as
* An instance of Vault accessible from AWS Lambda
* An authenticated `vault` client
* A secret in Vault that you want your Lambda to access, and a policy giving read access to it

First, set up AWS IAM auth on Vault, and attach a policy to your ARN:

```bash
vault auth enable aws
vault write -force auth/aws/config/client
vault write auth/aws/role/vault-lambda-role \
    auth_type=iam \
    bound_iam_principal_arn="${YOUR_ARN}" \
    policies="${YOUR_POLICY}" \
    ttl=1h
```

Add the extension to your Lambda layers using the console or [cli][lambda-add-layer-cli]:

```text
arn:aws:lambda:<your-region>:634166935893:layer:vault-lambda-extension:6
```

Configure the extension using [Lambda environment variables][lambda-env-vars]:

```bash
VAULT_ADDR=http://vault.example.com:8200    # Your Vault address
VAULT_AUTH_PROVIDER=aws                     # The AWS IAM auth mount point, i.e. the path segment after auth/ from above
VAULT_AUTH_ROLE=vault-lambda-role           # The Vault role to authenticate as. Must be configured for the ARN of your Lambda's role
VAULT_SECRET_PATH=secret/lambda-app/token   # The path to a secret in Vault. Can be static or dynamic.
                                            # Unless VAULT_SECRET_FILE is specified, JSON response will be written to /tmp/vault/secret.json
```

If everything is correctly set up, your Lambda function can then read secret
material from `/tmp/vault/secret.json`. The exact contents of the JSON object
will depend on the secret read, but its schema is the [Secret struct][vault-api-secret-struct]
from the Vault API module.

## Configuration

The extension is configured via [Lambda environment variables][lambda-env-vars].
Most of the [Vault CLI client's environment variables][vault-env-vars] are available,
as well as some additional variables to configure auth, which secret(s) to read and
where to write secrets. At least one valid secret to read must be specified.

Environment variable    | Description | Required | Example value
------------------------|-------------|----------|--------------
`VAULT_ADDR`            | Vault address to connect to | Yes | `https://x.x.x.x:8200`
`VAULT_AUTH_PROVIDER`   | Name of the configured AWS IAM auth route on Vault | Yes | `aws`
`VAULT_AUTH_ROLE`       | Vault role to authenticate as | Yes | `lambda-app`
`VAULT_SECRET_PATH`     | Secret path to read, written to `/tmp/vault/secret.json` unless `VAULT_SECRET_FILE` is specified | No | `database/creds/lambda-app`
`VAULT_SECRET_FILE`     | Path to write the JSON response for `VAULT_SECRET_PATH` | No | `/tmp/db.json`
`VAULT_SECRET_PATH_FOO` | Additional secret path to read, where FOO can be any name, as long as a matching `VAULT_SECRET_FILE_FOO` is specified | No | `secret/lambda-app/token`
`VAULT_SECRET_FILE_FOO` | Must exist for any correspondingly named `VAULT_SECRET_PATH_FOO`. Name has no further effect beyond matching to the correct path variable | No | `/tmp/token`

The remaining environment variables are not required, and function exactly as
described in the [Vault Commands (CLI)][vault-env-vars] documentation. However,
note that `VAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT` cannot extend the timeout beyond the 10s
timeout imposed by the Extensions API.

Environment variable    | Description | Required | Example value
------------------------|-------------|----------|--------------
`VAULT_CACERT`          | Path to a PEM-encoded CA certificate _file_ on the local disk | No | `/tmp/ca.crt`
`VAULT_CAPATH`          | Path to a _directory_ of PEM-encoded CA certificate files on the local disk | No | `/tmp/certs`
`VAULT_CLIENT_CERT`     | Path to a PEM-encoded client certificate on the local disk | No | `/tmp/client.crt`
`VAULT_CLIENT_KEY`      | Path to an unencrypted, PEM-encoded private key on disk which corresponds to the matching client certificate | No | `/tmp/client.key`
`VAULT_CLIENT_TIMEOUT`  | Timeout for Vault requests. Default value is 60s. **Any value over 10s will exceed the Extensions API timeout and therefore have no effect** | No | `5s`
`VAULT_MAX_RETRIES`     | Maximum number of retries on `5xx` error codes. Defaults to 2 | No | `2`
`VAULT_SKIP_VERIFY`     | Do not verify Vault's presented certificate before communicating with it. Setting this variable is not recommended and voids Vault's [security model][vault-security-model]  | No | `true`
`VAULT_TLS_SERVER_NAME` | Name to use as the SNI host when connecting via TLS | No | `vault.example.com`
`VAULT_RATE_LIMIT`      | Only applies to a single invocation of the extension. See [Vault Commands (CLI)][vault-env-vars] documentation for details | No | `10`
`VAULT_NAMESPACE`       | The namespace to use for the command | No | `education`
`VAULT_SRV_LOOKUP`      | The Vault client will lookup DNS SRV records for the host. See [Vault Commands (CLI)][vault-env-vars] documentation for details | No | `true`
`VAULT_MFA`             | MFA credentials. See [Vault Commands (CLI)][vault-env-vars] documentation for details | No | `true`

## Limitations

For this early release, the extension does not support automatic secret renewal.
This means once a secret is written to disk, it will not be refreshed once it
expires. This may cause problems if you use [provisioned concurrency][lambda-provisioned-concurrency]
or if your Lambda is invoked often enough that execution contexts live beyond
the lifetime of the secret.
